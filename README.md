# 🎙️ Voice AI Assistant

A production-ready Voice AI Assistant built with **Streamlit**, **Sarvam Speech-to-Text**, **Groq LLM**, **Tavily Search**, **ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech**, and **LangChain Message History**.

The assistant accepts voice input, intelligently decides whether internet search is required, generates conversational responses using a Large Language Model, and converts the response into natural human-like speech.

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Voice AI pipeline.

Instead of acting as a simple speech-to-text application, the assistant intelligently decides whether a user's question requires live internet information.

For example,

### Example 1

**User**

> Explain Machine Learning.

Since this is general knowledge, the assistant directly asks the LLM without performing web search.

---

### Example 2

**User**

> Who won yesterday's IPL match?

Since the answer depends on recent information, the assistant automatically performs an internet search using Tavily before generating the final response.

---

The complete interaction is voice-based.

# Features

## Voice Input

* Browser microphone recording
* Audio file upload support
* Sarvam Speech-to-Text
* Multi-language transcription support

---

## Intelligent Search Routing

The assistant does **not** search the internet for every question.

A lightweight Groq model first decides whether search is required.

This reduces

* API cost
* latency
* unnecessary web searches

---

## Live Internet Search

Questions requiring current information are answered using

* Tavily Search API

Examples

* News
* Sports
* Current Affairs
* Stock Market
* Weather
* Recent Technology

---

## AI Reasoning

Uses

**Groq Llama-3.3-70B**

to generate conversational responses.

Supports

* contextual conversations
* follow-up questions
* concise answers

---

## LangChain Conversation History

Conversation history is maintained using

* HumanMessage
* AIMessage

This makes the assistant ready for

* Memory
* Agents
* RAG
* Persistent Storage

---

## Human-like Voice

Responses are converted into realistic speech using

ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech.

Only AI responses are synthesized.

User queries are never sent to Text-to-Speech.

---

## Photorealistic Avatar

When Tavus is configured, the assistant can also generate a
photorealistic talking-head video for each AI reply.

The avatar feature is optional.

If avatar generation is unavailable, the assistant still responds
with text and audio.

---

## Guardrails

Unsafe prompts are blocked before reaching the LLM.

Examples include

* hacking
* malware
* bombs
* fraud
* violent requests

---

# Logging

The project uses **Loguru** as the centralized logging framework.

Every module imports the same logger instance.

```python
from src.logger import logger
```

The logger automatically records important events such as:

- Application startup
- Session initialization
- Speech transcription
- Guardrail validation
- Search decision
- Tavily search
- LLM generation
- Text-to-Speech synthesis
- Error handling

### Log Levels

| Level | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DEBUG | Internal debugging information |
| INFO | Normal execution |
| SUCCESS | Successful operation |
| WARNING | Recoverable issue |
| ERROR | Operation failed |
| EXCEPTION | Unexpected exception with traceback |

### Log Files

```
logs/

├── app.log
└── error.log
```

The application automatically rotates log files to prevent unlimited growth.

Current configuration:

- App log rotation: 10 MB
- Error log rotation: 5 MB
- Compression: ZIP
- Retention: 10–30 days


# Exception Handling

The application follows a centralized exception handling strategy.

Every module raises a `VoiceAssistantException` for unexpected failures.

Example:

```python
try:

    ...

except Exception as e:

    logger.exception("Speech transcription failed.")

    raise VoiceAssistantException(e)
```

A `VoiceAssistantException` automatically reports:

- File name
- Function name
- Line number
- Original exception

Example output:

```
VoiceAssistantException

File      : speech_to_text.py

Function  : transcribe_audio

Line      : 198

Error     : Missing SARVAM_API_KEY
```

This ensures that every unexpected failure is easy to debug and trace.



## Conversation History

Every user query becomes

```python
HumanMessage(
    content="..."
)
```

Every assistant response becomes

```python
AIMessage(
    content="..."
)
```

This provides

* conversation memory
* context-aware responses
* future RAG compatibility

---

## Search Decision

Instead of searching every question,

the assistant first asks

```
Does this question require live internet search?
```

Possible outputs

```
SEARCH
```

or

```
NO_SEARCH
```

Benefits

* Lower latency
* Reduced API cost
* Faster responses

---

## Internet Search

If required,

the assistant calls Tavily.

Search results are injected into the system prompt before generating the response.

---

## LLM

Groq Llama-3.3-70B generates the final answer.

The model receives

* previous conversation
* latest user question
* search results (when available)

---

## Text-to-Speech

Only

```python
AIMessage.content
```

is sent to ElevenLabs.

This ensures user prompts are never spoken back.

---

# LangChain Conversation History

Conversation is maintained as

```
Human

↓

AI

↓

Human

↓

AI
```

Example

```
User

Who is Elon Musk?

↓

Assistant

CEO of Tesla

↓

User

Where was he born?
```

Since previous messages are preserved,

the assistant understands

```
Where was he born?
```

without the user repeating

```
Elon Musk
```
